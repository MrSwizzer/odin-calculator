# Calculator

This project is part of **The Odin Project's Foundation curriculum**, where I created a simple **Calculator** application using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, allowing users to perform calculations directly in their browser.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- User-friendly interface with buttons for digits and operations.
- Clear and display results on the same page without refreshing.
- Handle edge cases, such as division by zero and continuous calculations.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the calculator interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout to create an intuitive user experience.
- **JavaScript**: For the calculator's functionality and interactive behavior.

## ðŸ“¸ Preview

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced the following skills:

- Implementing **JavaScript** functions to perform calculations and update the display dynamically.
- Managing state and user input effectively to ensure accurate results.
- Using event listeners to handle user interactions such as button clicks.
